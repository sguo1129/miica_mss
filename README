code is compiled in code directory by running ./build

code is run with ./run.sh shell script.

The run.sh script needs 4 input variables, the first one is data directory name, the second one
is first input processing scene_name, the third one is second input processing scene_name,
the fourth one is the final output image root filename (All output filenames are output image
root filename plus product name (e.g. ndvi, nbr, micca). The input and final output files are
both in the data directory, and the intermediate files are in the current code directory and
will be removed after their usages.

Example for running the code from command line: 
./run.sh /shared/users/sguo/mss_data LM50450301985132AAA04 LM50450301986135AAA03 LM5_045030_1985_1986
or:
./run.sh  /shared/users/sguo/mss_data/mss_2_3 LM20490291978151AAA02 LM30490301979173AAA05 LM23_049029_1978_1979

Note: 1. This code is only working for Landsat Archive Pre-Collection Level-1 L1-5
         MSS data, with some modification of filename and metadata, it can work
         for Landsat Legacy L1-5 MSS data 
      2. GDAL library is needed for compiling the code, on HPC server, gdal vesion 1.11.2 is tested and
         it is located at /shared/users/sguo/gdal-1.11.2
