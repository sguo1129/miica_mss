The script needs 4 input cariables, the first one is data directory name, the second one
is first processing scene_name name, the third one is second processing name, the fourth one is 
output name. The input and final output files are in the data directory, and the temporary text 
files are in the current code directory and will be removed after their usages

e.g. ./run.sh /shared/users/sguo/mss_data LM50450301985132AAA04 LM50450301986135AAA03 LM5045030_1985_1986
