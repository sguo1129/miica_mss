compiled in code directory by running ./bild

The script needs 4 input variables, the first one is data directory name, the second one
is first processing scene_name name, the third one is second processing name, the fourth one is 
output name. The input and final output files are in the data directory, and the temporary text 
files are in the current code directory and will be removed after their usages

e.g. ./run.sh /shared/users/sguo/mss_data LM50450301985132AAA04 LM50450301986135AAA03 LM5_045030_1985_1986
  or: ./run.sh  /shared/users/sguo/mss_data/mss_1_3 LM20490291978151AAA02 LM30490301979173AAA05 LM23_049029_1978_1979

Note: 1. This code is only working for Landsat Archive Pre-Collection Level-1 L1-5
         MSS data, with some modification of filename and metadata, it can work
         for Landsat Legacy L1-5 MSS data 
      2. GDAL library is needed for compiling the code, on HPC server, gdal vesion 1.11.2 is tested and it is located
         st /shared/users/sguo/gdal-1.11.2
